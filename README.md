# My Project
My project is about making a machine learning model that will classify different images of cars into the different types of cars, such as SUV, Sedan, Hatchback, Convertible, etc. :) 
# Common car brands ðŸš—
- Tesla  (Owned by US, Best-seller is the Model Y)
- Nissan (Established in Japan. Best-seller is the Nissan Rogue)
- BMW (German car brand. Best seller is the X5 Model)
- Mercedes-Benz (German car brand. Best seller is the GLC model)
- Jeep (American car brand, Best seller is the Grand Cherokee)
- Chevrolet (American car brand, Chevy Silverado is the best seller.)
- Porsche (German car brand, Best seller is the Porsche Cayenne.)
# Common Car types
- Sedan (Typically a four-door passenger car. Also has a three-box body: Engine, Area for passengers, and the Trunk)
- SUV (Stands for Sport Utility Vehicle. Typically is stylish, sleek-looking vehicles and also is typically has a more powerful engine. This allows it to do other things that normal cars cannot, such as climb steep hills and also go on roads that haven't been properly constructed. Most commonly used for travelling, or adventure.)
- Minivan (Typically has extra seating, which instead of being able to contain 5 people, it can usually contain up to 8 or 9 people.)
- Hatchback (Most commonly defined as: Being able to contain extra cargo space. This most commonly includes being able to bend over the second row of seats so that more cargo can be stored there. Most commonly used for moving, because you need the extra space for longer furniture.)
- Convertible (Typically defined as a car that can be drived without a roof, or with a removeable roof. This roof is usually removed by a button in the car, then moved back.)
- Sports car (Typically used for high-speed driving, racing, and typically aim for a very stylish, cool, look. Also typically a lot more expensive than normal cars.)
