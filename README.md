# What-Type-Is-My-Car? ðŸš—
# Intro
 A simple car type classifier, for the love of cars
 In this project, I aim to create a user-friendly tool that can automatically 
 classify various types of cars based on their visual features. Imagine showing the 
 model a car image, and it can tell you if it's a sports car, a sleek coupe, a rugged 
 SUV, or any other category, just like a car aficionado.

# My Project
My project is about making a machine learning model that will classify different images of cars into the different types of cars, such as SUV, Sedan, Hatchback, Convertible, etc. :) 

# Common Car types
- Convertible: A convertible car features a retractable roof, allowing drivers to enjoy open-air motoring on sunny days.

- Coupe: Coupes are typically two-door cars with a sleek and sporty design, often favored for their stylish appearance.

- Hatchback: Hatchbacks have a rear door that opens upwards, providing access to the cargo area, making them practical and versatile.

- Mini/Micro: These small cars are compact and fuel-efficient, perfect for urban driving and parking in tight spaces.

- Minivan: Minivans are spacious family vehicles known for their seating capacity and ample cargo space, making them ideal for larger families.

- Pickup Truck: Pickup trucks are versatile vehicles with an open cargo bed, suitable for hauling cargo and towing.

- Roadster: Roadsters are small, open-top sports cars designed for a thrilling driving experience with a focus on performance and style.

- Sedan: Sedans are four-door cars with separate compartments for the engine, passenger, and cargo, known for their comfortable and practical design.

- Sports Car: Sports cars are high-performance vehicles designed for speed and agility, often with a focus on aerodynamics and handling.

- Station Wagon: Station wagons are extended, family-friendly cars with a rear cargo area and a longer roofline.

- SUV (Sport Utility Vehicle): SUVs are rugged and versatile vehicles, combining the features of a sedan with off-road capabilities and ample cargo space.
